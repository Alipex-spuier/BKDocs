 ## FAQ 

 1.  If I do not applyPermission, can I not use the ITSM? 

    A: Not necessarily.  For Normal user, if they do No Need to Manage setting service and Flow, and only perform their own daily Ticket processing, or perform bill of lading Operation when necessary, they do not need to specifically Permission Application.  Personal Ticket view and processing entry is open to All user by default. 

 2.  If a third-party platform or tool is used for Task processing during Flow processing, does the third-party platform also have auth Check? 

    A: If the Operation of the third-party platform is also connected to the BlueKing auth system, the third-party will perform authentication Check on the Operator and Return the verification result when cross-system/platform interaction is involved.  If the auth is granted, the user will be guided to the accessCenter Application the corresponding permission before attempting the Operation.  We recommend that you Application for auth in advance before using a third-party system.
