 # Cloud resources 

 The CMDB provided One set of Base cloud resources synchronization functions to solve problems such as untimely Manage Update of cloud resources and inaccurate information. 

 The specific step are as follows: 

 1. create a cloud account 
 2. create Cloud resources Discovery Task 
 3. Allocate cloud resources 

 ## 1. create a cloud account 

 user need to apply to create One set of "sub-accounts" that can access all resources in the public cloud.  Different public cloud apply methods are slightly different.  Currently CMDB supports Account synchronization between Tencent Cloud and AWS. For more information on how to apply for an account, please see the following The document: 

 - Tencent Cloud: [https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/598/37140](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/598/37140) 
 - AWSï¼š[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers_enable-console-custom-url.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers_enable-console-custom-url.html)

 Complete the Set in Cloud area Settings: 

 1. Add the name of the cloud region corresponding to the VPC: Host IP resources in a VPC of a public cloud are not duplicated, and they are in one-to-one correspondence with Cloud area in the CMDB.  The public cloud resources under this VPC will be synchronized to this VPC 
 2. Set the directory that the Host enters into the resources pool: When the CMDB finds One new Host, it will be preferentially placed in the directory of the resources pool. By default, it is in the "idle machine" directory.  user can also create One directory dedicated to Storage new Host resources by department or purpose
