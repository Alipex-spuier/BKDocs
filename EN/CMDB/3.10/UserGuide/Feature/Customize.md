 # Customize Field 

 You can set the necessary Field for each level of the business, depending on the characteristics of the Business Name. 

 Enter the "Business Name-customize Field" function to view the existing Field Information of the Current cluster, module and Host. First, create One business group. 

 - Default collapse of group: When the customize Business Name Field is not isRequired and you want to decreased the disturbance, you can open the default collapse.  When you edit or create a node, you will not see the attributes of this group, and you need to actively open editing.
