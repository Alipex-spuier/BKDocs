 # Conclusion 

 Based on Golang, BlueKing reconstructs the BlueKing CMDB. Compared with the previous configuration platform (CMDB2.0), it provided brand-new machine data snapshot, auto data discovery, active Push of change event, more detailed Permissions, scalable Business Name topology and other functions. While the Run Efficiency of the system is greatly improved, the service and decentralized architecture design is adopted, so that the Deploy Release of the system can support the traditional mode and the container mode. 

 The new BlueKing CMDB has been officially open source.
