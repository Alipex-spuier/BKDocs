## Continuous deployment capability for massive automated operation and maintenance of heterogeneous businesses

The complexity of Tencent's gaming business and the heterogeneity of businesses from different developers around the world require the support team to provide a set of massive O&M control and continuous deployment solutions that are completely loosely coupled to the business. The control platform independently developed by Tencent BlueKing supports cross-cloud control of 200,000+ host nodes worldwide. Combined with configuration management, job execution, container management, standard O&M, fault self-healing and other capabilities, it greatly improves the degree of O&M automation and further safeguards the continuous deployment capabilities of the business.
