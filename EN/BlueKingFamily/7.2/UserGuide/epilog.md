# Conclusion

The development stages of the operation and maintenance industry are: **manual operation** > **script automation** > **WEB automation** > **scheduling automation** > **intelligent operation and maintenance**. Currently, many companies' operation and maintenance colleagues are still in the "**script automation**" stage, while the Tencent BlueKing team has completely experienced the baptism of the first four stages and is actively embracing the benefits brought by intelligent operation and maintenance.

In order to provide better services to the operation and maintenance industry, the Tencent BlueKingteam launched the open plan in March 2016 and has continuously increased its openness, even open source. Currently, the **Community Edition 6.0** has been opened, and its functional features allow operation and maintenance colleagues to directly enter the "**scheduling automation**" stage, and by improving their own capabilities, they can build operation and maintenance tools at a low cost and build their own operation systems.

On December 16, 2016, Dang Shouhui, head of Tencent Games' BlueKing Product Center, released the grand vision of the "**BlueKing**" brand "**Change China's operation and maintenance industry**". In the future, BlueKing will continue to build and maintain the community version, and create a rich operation and maintenance ecosystem including the BlueKing developer community, [SaaS market](http://bk.tencent.com/s-mart), and script community.

The operation and maintenance industry is a blue ocean. The BlueKing team hopes to cooperate with excellent companies to provide technical support to partners. BlueKing will focus more on technical research, continue to output more products, and serve the operation and maintenance industry together.

Note: The BlueKing system information will be continuously updated, and the specific features are subject to the functions of the available BlueKing software.
