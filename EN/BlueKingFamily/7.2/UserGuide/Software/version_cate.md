# Version Category

Tencent BlueKing has 2 main version lines: Community Edition and Enterprise Edition. According to the functions of the software packages and the technical service providers, they are subdivided into software basic packages, software enhancement packages, and partner software packages. The descriptions and product contents of each version are detailed in the table below:

| Version category | Detailed description |
|:--------------:|:-------:|
| Community version | It can be downloaded from the official website of Tencent BlueKing and used for free. The users are mainly individuals/enterprises in the operation and maintenance community. Through the power of the community, Tencent BlueKing can better verify the functions and performance of the product. At present, this version of the software consists of the basic platform (control platform, configuration platform, operation platform, PaaS platform) and the official SaaS (node ​​management, log platform, monitoring platform, standard operation and maintenance, etc.), and the PaaS platform can run various scenario SaaS developed based on the unified development framework of Tencent BlueKing. |
| Enterprise version | The enterprise version is a paid software, which is permanently authorized by purchasing a license. The users are mainly corporate customers. Its software products are superior to the community version in terms of functions, performance, and services. BlueKing "Enterprise Edition Technology Partner" is the authorized party for software sales and implementation. |

## Package Category

| Software package category | Detailed description |
|:--------------:|:-------:|
| Basic package | The basic package is the basic software for the implementation of automated operation and maintenance solutions within the enterprise, including the basic platform (control platform, configuration platform, operation platform, PaaS platform) and the official SaaS (such as: node management, monitoring platform, standard operation and maintenance, log platform, process service (formerly ITSM), etc.). |
| Enhanced package | The enhanced package is a collection of more advanced operation and maintenance products, which must be used together with the basic package. For example: container management package, monitoring log package, continuous integration package, etc., which are currently open source to the public. BlueKing only provides update services for the open source community. Partners can obtain source code packages from the open source community and provide them to customers according to enterprise needs. |
| Partner package | The partner package is a product of operation and maintenance solution scenarios provided by Tencent BlueKing partners. This type of product can provide users with more functional scenarios in the form of "plug-ins" based on the existing basic package. Since the developers/technical service providers are not the Tencent BlueKing team, matters involving cooperation, sales, promotion, etc. need to be discussed with the software provider. |
