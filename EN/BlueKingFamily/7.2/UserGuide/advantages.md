## PaaS Concept

The entire design of the software is based on the PaaS concept, which integrates with the enterprise's existing systems in a non-invasive manner and supports horizontal expansion.

## Atomic Platform

The bottom layer is composed of various atomic platforms, and each platform focuses on its own functional construction so that the upper-level scenario-based SaaS can flexibly and efficiently develop customized systems.

It not only provides a wealth of APIs, but also continuously enhances its openness. Its official core products provide plug-in/secondary development (open source project) models to promote the development of the operation and maintenance ecosystem.

## Enterprise Empowerment

Through various modes such as online and offline open courses, certification exams, operation and maintenance development challenges, etc., we empower enterprises, improve their technical capabilities, and enable enterprise employees to have the ability to build their own systems.
