# Preparation

Doing some preparation work before officially using BKLog will get twice the result with half the effort.

## Understand BKLog

You can read:

* [Product Introduction](../intro/README.md)

## Create a business or apply for a business

BKLog data all uses **business** as the namespace. Therefore, to start using BKLog, you first need to apply for an existing business or create a new business.

Create a business: [How to create a business and import hosts into the business](../../../../CMDB/3.10/UserGuide/QuickStart/case1.md).

Apply for a business: Apply for viewing or editing permissions for the business through the permission center.

## Access Request

BKLog has been connected to the permission center and no longer relies on the role of the configuration platform. You need to go to the permission center to apply for permissions according to the prompts. The granularity of permissions can be refined to the index set.

For details, please view [Permission Application](./perm.md).

## Install the log collector plug-in

The log collection function relies on the log collector bkunifylogbeat, which is installed in node management.
