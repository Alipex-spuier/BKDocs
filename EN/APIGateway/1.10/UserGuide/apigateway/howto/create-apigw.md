# Create gateway

A gateway is a collection of resources. You need to create a gateway first, and then you can create a new environment and create new resources under the gateway.

## Create a public gateway

For public gateways, users can apply for gateway API permissions in the `BlueKing Developer Center` and view the documentation of the gateway API in the `API Help Center`.

Visit `BlueKing API Gateway`, under the **My Gateway** menu, click **Create Gateway**, fill in the gateway name and description, check `Is it public` (checked by default), click **Create** to create a public gateway.

## Create a non-public gateway

For non-public gateways, the gateway is hidden from users and will not be displayed in the BlueKing Developer Center or API Help Center.

Under the **My Gateway** menu, click **Create Gateway**, fill in the gateway name and description, uncheck `Is it public`, and click **Create** to create a non-public gateway.
