# product description

BlueKing API Gateway is a high-performance, high-availability API hosting service that can help developers create, publish, maintain, monitor and protect APIs.
Open the data or services of BlueKing applications or other systems to the outside world quickly, at low cost and with low risk.

The API gateway supports two access methods: online access and coded access, and provides unified **BlueKing application authentication**, **user authentication**, **request forwarding**, and **logging* * and other functions.

## Online access

In the API gateway, developers directly register the backend interface information to the API gateway through online configuration and provide API services. APIs accessed in this way are called gateway APIs.

With the online access method, developers do not need to write code. They can connect their interfaces to the API gateway only through online configuration, which is convenient and fast.

## Coding access

In the API gateway, developers use python language to write component code according to development specifications, configure component information to the API gateway and provide API services. APIs accessed in this way are called component APIs.

For the coding access method, developers need to be familiar with the Python language and write component codes. In this way, developers can convert the protocol of the back-end interface, combine multiple interfaces, etc., and can support richer scenarios.
