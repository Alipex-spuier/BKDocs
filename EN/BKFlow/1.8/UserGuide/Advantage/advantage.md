# Product Advantages

BKFlow is a platform-oriented, efficient and flexible process engine platform designed to help access systems quickly acquire process execution capabilities.

If the business system you develop needs to execute specific process tasks, or requires system users to orchestrate and execute process tasks themselves, then BKFlow can help you quickly implement it and provide you with sufficiently flexible custom expansion capabilities to meet the business needs of the system and users.

## Embeddable process orchestration capabilities

BKFlow provides general process orchestration capabilities for access systems, including canvas orchestration, node & variable configuration, decision rule management, debugging solution configuration, etc., covering common business scenarios of access systems.

The access system can directly embed BKFlow's canvas integrated process orchestration capabilities and manage user permissions through the token mechanism.

## Scalable task execution capabilities

BKFlow supports access system developers and users to implement custom business logic through API plug-ins and BlueKing plug-ins, and batch generate corresponding plug-ins in BKFlow for access system users to use, thereby meeting the task execution requirements of business processes.

## Powerful rule decision-making capabilities

During the process of process execution, it is often necessary to execute different branch logics according to different situations. Complex branch judgment logic may make the process arrangement extremely complicated.

BKFlow integrates a self-developed decision engine, which supports access system developers and users to define decision tables based on industry standard syntax, thereby realizing rule decisions for business logic, which can greatly simplify the complexity of process arrangement.

## Comprehensive resource management capabilities

BKFlow provides an Admin management terminal for access system developers. Access system developers (space administrators) can manage all resources under the corresponding space, including space configuration, processes, tasks, decision tables, etc.

## Support experience first, then access

On the product homepage, each user can create his own space and experience the complete functions on the Admin management terminal.

If the function can meet the business needs, then choose to access BKFlow.
