# Basic concepts

This article introduces some terms and basic concepts specific to the BlueKing Message Notification Center.

## Activity Announcement
“**Activity Announcement**” is one type of message that users post on the platform. Its scenario is to help the product management team quickly push irregular product activities to users of the corresponding products. Its presentation method is that users will receive corresponding notification messages when they log in to the third-party system for the first time on the same device or clear the local cache.

## Platform Announcement
“**Platform Announcement**” is another type of announcement message. Its scenario is to provide the platform management team with a message type that needs to be notified to users in emergency situations such as product release changes and failures. Its presentation method is to be suspended and adsorbed on the top of the corresponding third-party SaaS. Because of its high importance, it will stay and cannot be closed, emphasizing the importance of information!

## Marquee
“**Marquee**” corresponds to the message type of “**Platform Announcement**”. Because of its feature of being adsorbed on the top of the page, the volume ratio of the information is not high, so it will automatically rotate according to the length of the announcement content, thus becoming a “marquee”.

## Pop-up window
“**Pop-up window**” corresponds to the “**Activity Announcement**” type, which, as the name implies, is presented in the form of a pop-up window on the product page.
