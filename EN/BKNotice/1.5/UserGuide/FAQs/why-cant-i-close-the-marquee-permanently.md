# Why can't I permanently turn off the platform announcement ticker?

"Platform Announcement" type messages are defined by us as the most important content, which means that this information is very important to the current users of the platform! For example: the platform service is under maintenance or failure, which will directly affect the user experience; due to some force majeure, the platform will suspend or stop service; etc... This kind of message that your system users need to pay attention to at the first time and all the time, we hope that users will not choose to turn it off because of "impatient" or "eyesore", which will lead to some communication errors caused by inaccurate information! Therefore, users can only turn off "Platform Announcement" type messages once (that is, it will appear again after refreshing or jumping the page), and cannot be turned off or blocked permanently.
