## Operation steps

If you want to display the announcements published in the message notification center in your own SaaS, you must first consume the corresponding data through the message notification service! You can choose to integrate the front-end SDK of the BlueKing Message Notification Center, or obtain the announcements published in the message notification center by calling the open interface of the message notification center. (The SDK and interface can be obtained in the development document)
