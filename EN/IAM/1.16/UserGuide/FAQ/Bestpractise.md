# Does the IAM have recommended best practices?

The IAM supports instance-level permissions, but this does not mean that permissions have to be granted one at a time. We recommend that the best practice is **Grading Manager + UserGroup** permission management.

For detailed information on best practices, see [UserCase](../UserCase/GradingManager.md).
