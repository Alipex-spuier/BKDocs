 # User/Organization 

 Organization architecture Manager is currently a Super Administrator ([How to become a Super Administrator](../ProductFeatures/Manager.md)). 

 ## Precondition 

 > 1. User is Super Administrator

  By default, BKIAM synchronizes the personal and organizational information managed by BlueKing users in the form of organizational architecture, so that the administrator can manage permissions in the **Person** and **Organization** dimensions. 

 In the **User** menu, you can view and manage the permissions of a person or an organization.
