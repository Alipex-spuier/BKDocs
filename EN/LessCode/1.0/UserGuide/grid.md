:::info
Visual development layout supports grid layout and free layout. Here we introduce grid layout.

### The grid layout has rows and multiple columns that can be quickly dragged to generate a page layout.

### Multi-column components can increase the number of columns. The default is 2 columns and the maximum is 12 columns. The number of columns and the width of each column can be set through the properties panel. We recommend using the principle of 12 or 24 equal parts when dragging and dropping layouts.

### You can also achieve a more flexible layout by modifying the size, margins and other styles.
