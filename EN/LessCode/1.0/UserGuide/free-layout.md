## Layout - Free Layout

:::info
Visual development layout supports grid layout and free layout. Free layout is introduced here.

### Free layout is an area with a default height of 500px and a transparent background. The height, width and background color can be modified through the style panel on the right.

### The first time you drag a component from the left panel into the free layout, it will be placed in the upper left corner of the free layout by default.

### Components in the free layout can be dragged at will. During the dragging process, there will be yellow auxiliary lines between components, and there will also be a 3px adsorption effect to help you easily align the components.

### The relationship between free layout and grid layout

The visual development canvas supports three types, grid layout, free layout and ordinary components. The relationship between them is

- Only ordinary components can be placed in free layout, not grid layout and free layout.
- Ordinary components in free layout cannot be dragged into grid layout, nor can they be dragged into another free layout
- Grid layout, free layout and ordinary components can be placed in grid layout
- Common components in grid layout can be dragged into other free layouts and other grid layouts
- Grid layout and free layout in grid layout cannot be dragged into another free layout or another grid layout
