## Guidelines for using application templates
lesscode provides a rich set of application-level templates, including complete content used in the application, such as functions, variables, databases, etc. Users can directly reference it without assembling it from 0 to 1. When using it, you only need to modify the corresponding content to quickly Complete application development.

### How to use application templates?
There are two ways to use application templates: one is to add them through the template market, and the other is to add them on the application list page.

### The first type: add through the template market
1. Enter the template market, select the appropriate application template, and click Apply
* Application: New applications can be created based on templates
* Download source code: You can directly download the application template source code for secondary development
