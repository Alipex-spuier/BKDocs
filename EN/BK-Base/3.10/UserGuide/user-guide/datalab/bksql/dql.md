# DQL (data query) statement

## BKSQL query syntax

The query SQL syntax complies with the SQL-92 standard, and the main syntax is a Select statement, as shown below

```mysql
SELECT ... FROM ... WHERE ... GROUP BY ...
```

Common syntax includes: DISTINCT, COUNT DISTINCT, COUNT IF, SUM IF, UNION, UNION ALL, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, JOIN, FULL JOIN

* ### Supported operators

   BKSQL query syntax supports standard SQL four types of operators, as shown below

   * Arithmetic operators: + (addition), - (subtraction), \* (multiplication), / (division), % (remainder or modulo)

   * Comparison operators: =, &lt;=&gt;, &lt;&gt; \(!=\), &lt;=, &gt;=, &gt;, IS NULL, IS NOT NULL, IN, NOT IN, BETWEEN . . . AND. . ., LIKE, NOT LIKE

   * Logical operators: NOT\(logical NOT\), AND\(logical AND\), OR\(logical OR\), XOR\(XOR\)

   * Bit operators: bitwise OR (\|), bitwise AND (&), bitwise XOR (^)

* ### Supported expressions

   BKSQL query syntax supports standard SQL expressions as shown below

   * Arithmetic expression: Supports \(+ - \* / % \) arithmetic operators to form expressions, and the result of the expression is a numerical value.

     grammar:

     ```sql
     SELECT numerical_expression as OPERATION_NAME[FROM table_name WHERE CONDITION];
     ```

     example:

     ```sql
     SELECT (1+2) from tableA where tableA.c1=1000;
     ```

   * Conditional expression: supports comparison operators such as \(= = &gt; &gt;= &lt; &lt;= != is is not in not in like not like\), and logical operators \(AND, OR\) or A conditional expression composed of parentheses, the result of the expression is true or false.

     grammar:

     ```sql
     SELECT column1, column2, columnN FROM table_name WHERE [CONDITION|EXPRESSION];
     ```

     example:

     ```sql
     SELECT c1 from tableA where tableA.c1=1000;
     ```

   * Branch expression: Case ... When ... Then ... \[Else\] ... End

     Syntax 1:

     ```mysql
     CASE input_expression
     WHEN when_expression THEN
       result_expression [...n ] [
     ELSE
         else_result_expression
     END
     ```

     Syntax 2:

     ```mysql
     CASE
     WHEN Boolean_expression THEN
       result_expression [...n ] [
     ELSE
         else_result_expression
     END
     ```

     example:

     ```mysql
     select case worldid when 1001 then 100100 when 1002 then 100200 else 100000 end as new_worldid from tableA;
     ```

   * Regular expressions: Different storage engines have different writing methods for regular expressions. Please refer to their respective official documents for details.
