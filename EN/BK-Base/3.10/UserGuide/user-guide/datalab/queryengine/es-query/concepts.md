# Full Text Search

## Features

Full-text search provides a data query function based on Elasticsearch. Like SQL query, you first need to select the result data table on the left. Different from SQL query, full-text search does not require explicit writing of SQL. You only need to enter the corresponding search keywords.

The result display of full-text search is relatively rich, not only the table display of the result data, but also the corresponding data distribution diagram and keyword highlighting, and the time span supports minutes, hours, days, weeks and months.

### Full text search example is as follows
