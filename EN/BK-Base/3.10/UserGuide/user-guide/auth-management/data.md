In "Data Query", if there is no expected result data table in the list, it means that you do not have the query permission for the result data table. Please follow [My Permissions] (./permission) on "How to View the Results for which You Have Permissions" Data" chapter guide to confirm or apply for the corresponding permissions.

## Data development and creation project, why canâ€™t I see the data in the project?

**After the project is initialized, there will be no result data available for secondary calculation. Project members need to apply for the corresponding result data. **After the project applies for the result data, project members can view the data content within the project and perform secondary calculations on the data content to generate new result data.

On the "My Projects" page, click the small icon as shown in the figure to apply for the result data in the platform.

## Third-party application query data


Go to [Authorization Management](./token.md), specify the result data table and application name, and generate an authorization code. The third party carries the APP account information and authorization code to call the platform interface for data query. **The authorization code will expand the scope of use of the data, please apply and approve carefully**

## Third-party application subscription data

Go to [Authorization Management](./token.md), specify the result data table and application name, and generate an authorization code. Third parties need to use the Kafka SDK provided by the platform to pass the APP account information and authorization code for data subscription. For more information, please refer to the [Data Subscription](../datahub/subscription/concepts.md) document guidelines.
