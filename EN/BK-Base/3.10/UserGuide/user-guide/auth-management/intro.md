# Authority management

Permission management manages all platform objects, object relationships and personnel role relationships, and strictly follows the RBAC model for permission control. Supports sensitivity classification and uses different permission control strategies for access control on different sensitive level data sets on the platform. The platform opens API capabilities, and third parties can access the data interface through authorization codes.
