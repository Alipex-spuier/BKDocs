### life cycle
On the life cycle page, you can check the **heat and breadth** of the data and understand the **value of the data**.

- **Hotness**
Indicates the frequency of data application. The higher the score (100-point scale), the more frequent the application.
Mainly measured by the number of times the current data has been queried (queries in the last 7 days),
For example, if the number of queries is higher, the popularity score will be higher, and vice versa.

- **Breadth**
Indicates how widely the data is used. The higher the score (100-point scale), the more widely used it is.
It is mainly measured by factors such as the business, project, and calculation-generated data in which the current data is used.
For example, the more businesses and projects are used, and the more result tables generated by data development, the breadth score will be higher, and vice versa.
