# Apply for model application permissions

## Introduction to model application permissions
Model application permissions: permissions to apply models in data development.

When creating a model, you can choose the application permissions of the model to be `Project Private` or `Public. `

- Project private: This model can only be applied under the current project. You need to apply for application permission before using it in other projects.

- Public: All projects can apply the model.

## Apply for model application permissions by project

Open the model name drop-down box of the model application node and search for the model. If the project does not have application permissions, it will be gray. Click to apply for permissions.
