Model release
----

Model publishing is to publish the alternative models submitted during the model experiment phase as an `online version`. The released model can be used as a `time series model application` node in the data development task to provide model prediction services.

Model release includes `manual release` and `automatic release`.

## Manual release
Based on the evaluation results of the alternative models, manually select an alternative model and publish it as an online model.
