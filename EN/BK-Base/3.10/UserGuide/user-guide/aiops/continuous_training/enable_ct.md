You can set the frequency of continuous training, such as training every hour or every day.

Note: When starting continuous training, it will be checked whether the samples used in the experiment have been updated compared to the last training. If not, continuous training will not be started. Please make sure the sample has automatic feedback added or the sample added automatically.
