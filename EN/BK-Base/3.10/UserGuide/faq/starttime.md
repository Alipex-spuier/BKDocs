## `_startTime_` and `_endTime_`

### basic introduction

`_startTime_`: real-time calculation of system fields, window start time
`_endTime_`: real-time calculation of system fields, window end time
   - Calculation scenarios: scrolling/sliding/accumulation/session window type real-time calculation node result table:
     - The window start time and window end time are respectively the start time and end time of the window where the data is marked when the real-time computing node processes this data.
   - Computing scenario: windowless type real-time calculation node result table
     - The upstream data source of the windowless real-time node is the result table of data integration cleaning: the window start time and window end time are equal, and the actual meaning is [dtEventTime](../faq/localtime.md)
     - The upstream data source of the windowless real-time node is the result table generated by real-time calculation: the window start time and window end time are respectively the start time and end time of the window where the data is marked when the upstream real-time calculation node processes this data.
   - Computing scenario: real-time computing node result table for static correlation processing between real-time data source and real-time associated data source
     - The real-time data source is the result table of data integration cleaning: the window start time and window end time are equal, and the actual meaning is [dtEventTime](../faq/localtime.md) of the real-time data source
     - The result table generated by real-time data source for real-time calculation: window start time and window end time are respectively the start time and end time of the window where the data is marked when the upstream real-time computing node of the real-time data source processes this data.

### Examples of correct usage

* In the result table, determine the window in which the calculation result data is located by viewing the window start/end time field value of the data.
* Use the window start/end time field in the SQL group statement (GROUP BY) of the real-time calculation node to group the upstream result data again for calculation
* Use the window start/end time field setting alias as a normal field, such as: ```SELECT `_startTime_` AS `startPos` ```

### Examples of incorrect usage

* Directly select the window start/end time field and display it as a calculation result table field. Such as: ```SELECT `_startTime_` , `_endTime_` ```
* Set the alias of the common field to the window start/end time field, overwriting the system field. Such as: ```SELECT `report_time` AS `_startTime_` ```
