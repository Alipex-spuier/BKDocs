## core advantages


1. **Ecological closed loop:** Relying on BlueKing PaaS, it deeply integrates CMDB, fault self-healing, log platform, operation platform, node management, data platform, work orders and other capabilities. As the ecosystem improves, the intelligence of monitoring will become even more powerful.

2. **Observation scenario - out-of-the-box use:** Default host, process monitoring, dialing test capabilities, container monitoring and APM, as well as default system events and policy configuration, which can meet basic out-of-the-box use

3. **Data integration - support collection management:** A simple script can collect data, support online debugging and collection of scripts, and full life cycle hosting. There is no need to consider how to deploy and manage scripts. Supports the Exporter data collection format of Prometheus and can easily migrate the Exporter to the monitoring platform plug-in.

4. **SDK reporting:** Supports custom reporting of timing and event data through HTTP, Prometheus SDK, and OpenTelemetry SDK.

5. **Alarm configuration-alarm and self-healing:** Flexible policy configuration meets single machine, single instance, cluster, multi-dimensional and other alarm needs; built-in 8 static detection algorithms and 3 intelligent detection algorithms; multiple alarm convergence etc. to prevent alarm storms, etc.
