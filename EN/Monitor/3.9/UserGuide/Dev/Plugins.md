## Collector overview

In addition to self-developed collectors, BlueKing also has basic performance collectors and component monitoring collectors based on Beats. In addition, the component collector supports Prometheus Exporter and self-service import, and 100+ open source components from DataDog. For details of the collector, please refer to the table below:


| Collector | Collection range | Application scenarios |
| ------| -------- | ------- |
| * Basereport (basic performance collector) | Real-time status of host hardware configuration information, CPU, memory, disk, network, etc. | Real-time detection of the overall status of the host, applied to CMDB - host snapshot data display, monitoring platform - host monitoring |
| * Bkmetricbeat (component performance collector) | The status, performance and other real-time status of open source components and middleware layer services (providing access support, users must develop their own Prometheus collector for components not covered) | Collect Metrics information of components, Supports open source components such as Redis, Apache, Nginx, etc., and is also responsible for hosting the DataDog collector and Prometheus Exporter, which is used in the monitoring platform - Component Monitoring |
| Exporter (component performance collector) | Hosted on Bkmetricbeat, the built-in Exporter integrates the mature collector ecosystem of Prometheus. It does not require complex configuration like a custom Exporter, and its scalability and maintainability are better than the default components, making it Users can quickly take advantage of the powerful collection capabilities of Prometheus Exporter. | Built-in Exporter collector support: Haproxy, Memcache, SQL Server, Oracle, Weglogic, RabbitMQ, ZooKeeper, etc., used in monitoring platform-component monitoring |
| DataDog (component performance collector) | Hosted on Bkmetricbeat, in order to further enhance the collection capabilities of the monitoring platform, DataDog's collection method is expanded based on the existing component monitoring collection architecture. By encapsulating a layer of DataDog Http Server based on DataDog Agent Integrations, a passive collection method similar to Prometheus Exporter is achieved. | Built-in DataDog collector support: Kafka, Microsoft AD, Ceph, Consul, Elasticsearch, Exchange_Server_2010, Microsoft IIS, MongoDB, etc., applied to monitoring platform-component monitoring |
| * Processbeat (process performance collection) | Monitoring port status and performance of processes in the host | Timely detection of process abnormalities to avoid chain reactions caused by process abnormalities, applied to monitoring platform - host monitoring - process monitoring collection |
| * Unifytlogc (high-performance log collector) | User-selected log files in the host | Filter, collect and report user-specific log files, find problems from the logs, and apply them to the monitoring platform - customized monitoring/dashboard view |
| * Gsecmdline (customized reporting command line tool) | Collect specified data based on scripts issued by users | For data that cannot be covered by other collectors or user-developed services, users can write their own scripts to collect data and report it through Gsecmdline for application monitoring Platform-Customized Monitoring/Dashboard View |
| * Uptimecheckbeat (dial test monitoring collector) | Regularly proactively detect services selected by users | Users can make regular requests to specified services through three protocols: HTTP, TCP, and UDP, and monitor and detect whether the returned content and response time meet the user's requirements Settings, proactively discover and eliminate hidden dangers, applied to monitoring platform-Dialtest Monitoring |
