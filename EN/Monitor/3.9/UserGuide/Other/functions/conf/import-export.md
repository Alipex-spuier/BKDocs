### Import

The batch exported content can be directly imported to another business or another monitoring platform. Combined with the template function, monitoring configuration content can be easily shared.

> **Warning:** After importing, if it is the same monitoring target, it is strongly recommended to set a unified monitoring target at this time. Unified settings are not currently performed, and the configuration after import needs to be set one by one. And it is recommended to export the same monitoring target for easy management.

If you import too much content, it may take a long time. If you leave midway and it is not completed, you can also check the import history.

> **Note**: By default, the import history will only retain the data of the past 30 days. After 30 days, the records and imported data will be cleared.
