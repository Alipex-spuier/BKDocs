# Alarm group

The alarm group is the same as daily management. There will be a group of people responsible for a piece of content at the same time, receiving alarms and processing them together. Then this group of people belongs to an alarm group.

Functions are divided into operations, development, product, and testing. But in fact, operation and maintenance also involves group A operation and maintenance, and group B operation and maintenance, so the granularity of the alarm group is controlled by the management granularity.
