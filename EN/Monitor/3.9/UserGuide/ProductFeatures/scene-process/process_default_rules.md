There are three process-related policies by default:

1. Gse process hosting event alarms are alarms for the running status of all processes hosted under the `Node Management` GSE Agent. They are on the platform side and the business side. The platform side is sent to the administrator by default, and the business side is sent to the operation and maintenance role by default.
2. Process port, the default process port connectivity is issued to the operation and maintenance role by default.
