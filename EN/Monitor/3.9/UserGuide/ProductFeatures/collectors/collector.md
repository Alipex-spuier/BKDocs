# Collector overview

Different collectors have different usage scenarios.

| Collector | Collection range | Application scenarios |
| ----- | -------- | --------------- |
| Basereport (basic performance collector) | Real-time status of host hardware configuration information, CPU, memory, disk, network, etc. | Real-time detection of overall host status, applied to CMDB - Host snapshot data display, monitoring platform - Host monitoring |
| Bkmetricbeat (plug-in collector) | Provides data cleaning and conversion capabilities for plug-ins, converting different data formats into the data format of the standard monitoring platform. | All plug-in requirements such as Exporter, DataDog, Script, JMX, etc. |
| Exporter (plug-in) | Hosted on Bkmetricbeat, the built-in Exporter integrates the mature collector ecosystem of Prometheus. It does not require complex configuration like a custom Exporter, and its scalability and maintainability are better than the default components, allowing users to quickly Use the powerful collection capabilities of Prometheus Exporter. | Built-in Exporter collector support: Haproxy, Memcache, SQL Server, Oracle, Weglogic, RabbitMQ, ZooKeeper, etc., used in monitoring platform-component monitoring |
| DataDog (plug-in) | Hosted on Bkmetricbeat, in order to further enhance the collection capabilities of the monitoring platform, DataDog's collection method is expanded based on the existing component monitoring collection architecture. By encapsulating a layer of DataDog Http Server based on DataDog Agent Integrations, a passive collection method similar to Prometheus Exporter is achieved. | Built-in DataDog collector support: Kafka, Microsoft AD, Ceph, Consul, Elasticsearch, Exchange_Server_2010, Microsoft IIS, MongoDB, etc., applied to monitoring platform-component monitoring |
| BK-Pull (remote pull collector) | Such as tomcat | Application scenarios that require remote pull |
| Processbeat (process performance collection | Monitoring port status and performance of processes in the host | Timely detection of process abnormalities to avoid chain reactions caused by process abnormalities, applied to monitoring platforms - host monitoring - process monitoring collection |
| BKLogBeat (high-performance log collector) | User-selected log files in the host | Filter, collect and report user-specific log files, find problems from the logs, and apply them to the monitoring platform - customized monitoring/dashboard view |
| Gsecmdline (customized reporting command line tool) | Collect specified data based on scripts issued by users | For data that cannot be covered by other collectors or user-developed services, users can write their own scripts to collect data and report it through Gsecmdline, application monitoring platform -Customized monitoring/dashboard view |
| Uptimecheckbeat (dial test monitoring collector) | Periodically proactively detect services selected by users | Users can make regular requests to designated services through three protocols: HTTP, TCP, and UDP, and monitor and detect whether the returned content and response time comply with user settings Determine, proactively discover and eliminate hidden dangers, and apply it to the monitoring platform-Dialtest Monitoring |
