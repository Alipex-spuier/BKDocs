# Temporary sharing

The temporary sharing master is used to solve the usage scenario where permissions cannot be approved for a certain user, but also wants relevant people to quickly perform a positioning.

## Function scope

All observation objects and integrated visualization data of the observation scene can be temporarily shared, excluding dashboards

## Temporary sharing management

1. If the person receiving the shared link has permission, it will be the same as a normal link.
2. The person who receives the sharing link does not have permission and will only see the subject instance of this sharing, not the list page or business topology tree.
3. Those who share links can control the validity period and the time range of selected data, and can also cancel the content shared by Kuaifen.
