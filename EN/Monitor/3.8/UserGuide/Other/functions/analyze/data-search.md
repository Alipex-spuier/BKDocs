# Data retrieval

Current data retrieval can directly retrieve two types of data, indicators and log data. The purpose of data retrieval is to quickly query data when analyzing and positioning.

## Differences from dashboard and scene view

**Dashboard** is mainly based on solidified charts, and a query in the dashboard can only be one chart. If the queried data exceeds the upper limit of 20, the data cannot be drawn, and of course there is no way to see the real data.

**Scene View** What is a scene view? For example: the details of the host and the inspection view in the collection. Compared with the dashboard, it does not require the user to configure it and simply and violently presents known data.

**Data retrieval** You can query multiple graphs at one time, and you can quickly switch between different perspectives and drill down on data.
