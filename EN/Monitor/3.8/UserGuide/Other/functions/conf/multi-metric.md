# 1.Multiple indicator calculations

Multi-indicator calculation refers to flexible expression support such as addition, subtraction, multiplication and division for different monitoring indicators to meet different usage scenarios.

The monitoring platform supports the use of multiple indicator calculation methods in **policy configuration** and **dashboard**.

# 2. Strategy configuration-multi-indicator calculation

Multi-indicator calculation. In the panel for adding monitoring indicators, you can select multiple indicators. For example, below we have selected two indicators: **application memory usage** and **total physical memory size** to demonstrate application memory. Usage alarm policy configuration. Of course, the monitoring platform defaults to its own indicator of application memory usage.

After selecting the indicator, fill in the expression

```bash
# The A and B of this expression are automatically generated by the selected indicator system. A represents the "total physical memory size" indicator, and B represents the "application memory usage" indicator. Multiplying by 100 is a value that directly converts the percentage into a percentage, then When configuring the alarm policy threshold, for example, if the configuration is >10%, then the threshold can be configured as 10.
B/A*100
```

# 3. Dashboard-Multiple indicator calculations

Multi-indicator calculations can also be displayed on the dashboard. After four arithmetic operations on indicator a and indicator b, a graph is produced, as shown below.
