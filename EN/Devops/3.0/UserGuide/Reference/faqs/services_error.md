 ## Q4: BK-CICI machine occupies too much space 

 You can check what file are taking up space. 

 Generally speaking, the build product takes up more space. You can use the BlueKing Job System to clean the build product regularly. 



 ## Q5: The bandwidth between BK-CI and BlueKing MySQL is very large 

 After view, it is mainly the BK-CI-misc.service process that sends and receives traffic. 

 This was a Cron for BK-CI. They would scan and clean up every 12 Second.  The reason for the high traffic is mainly the logic of running data cleaning. 

 If the bandwidth consumption is too large, you can reduce the number of cleaning threads approve build.data.clear.maxThreadHandleProjectNum setting decreased the number of mysql operations.
