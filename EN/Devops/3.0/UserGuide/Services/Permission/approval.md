 # Approval Permission Application 

 Each userGroup request from a user corresponds to a request form: 
 - userGroup at the project level, to be approved by the project manager 
 - userGroup at the resource level, to be approved by the resource owner 

 The approver can process the request on the My Approvals page:

 - Batch approval is also possible
