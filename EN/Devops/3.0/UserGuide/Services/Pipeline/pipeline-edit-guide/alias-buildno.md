 # Enable customize buildNo for pipeline 

 ## Why do I need to customize buildNo? 

 The default pipeline buildNo is composed of numbers that increase by 1. To increase visibility, we allow you to set aliasName for the pipeline build number. When enabled, your customize buildNumberFormat will be preferentially displayed on the page display. 

 ## Enable method 

 Enter the basic pipeline settings page and set the appropriate buildNo rule, for example 

 ```text 
 ${{DATE:"yyMMdd"}}.$ {{BUILD_NO_OF_DAY}} 
 ```
