## Authorization Scenarios

BlueKing Developer Center supports using Gitee as the source code repository, adopting the `OAuth2` authorization scheme.

### Associated Permissions

After authorizing access to your Gitee code repository information, BlueKing will have permissions to access your **private** and **public** repositories.

### Authorization Revocation

If you no longer wish to authorize the Developer Center, you can choose to revoke the corresponding permissions.

**Note**: Revoking authorization will not delete the corresponding information on the Gitee side. If you want to completely clean up, please go to the [Gitee settings page](https://gitee.com/oauth/applications) to operate.
