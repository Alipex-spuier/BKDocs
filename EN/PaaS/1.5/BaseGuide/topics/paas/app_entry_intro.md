# Configure BlueKing Application Access Entry

## Introduction

Once your application is developed, it can be accessed through the entry provided by the BlueKing Developer Center.

Currently, the BlueKing Developer Center provides a default entry for all applications. As long as it is deployed to the corresponding environment, it can be accessed through the BlueKing desktop (APP Market) or the default URL provided by BlueKing.

For developers with special needs, you can now configure a 'Custom Access Address' in the BlueKing Developer Center to add additional access entries for BlueKing applications.

## Custom Access Address

By adding a custom access address, you can use a personalized domain name other than the default provided address to access your BlueKing application.

Configuration Guide:

- Add a custom access address on the 'Access Management' page.
- Click 'How to Configure Domain Resolution' in the upper right corner of the page to view the corresponding target IP address.
- Point your custom domain name resolution to the above target IP.
