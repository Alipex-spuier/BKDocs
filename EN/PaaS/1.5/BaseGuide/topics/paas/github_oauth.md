## Authorization Scenarios

BlueKing Developer Center supports using GitHub as the source code repository, adopting an `OAuth2` authorization scheme.

### Associated Permissions

After authorizing access to your GitHub code repository information, BlueKing will have permissions to access your **private** and **public** repositories.

### Authorization Deletion

If you no longer wish to authorize the Developer Center, you can choose to cancel the corresponding authorization.

**Note**: Canceling authorization will not delete the corresponding information on GitHub. If you want to completely clean up, please go to the [GitHub settings page](https://github.com/settings/applications) to operate.
