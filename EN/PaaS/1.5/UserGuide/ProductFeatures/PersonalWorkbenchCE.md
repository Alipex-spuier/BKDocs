# Personal Workspace

BlueKing provides many out-of-the-box SaaS products, which are uniformly displayed in the user's "Personal Workspace." To avoid an overcrowded workspace that could affect work efficiency, you can adjust the entrance to the SaaS systems by "sorting."

As shown in the figure below: "Login" -> "Sort" -> Drag and drop to adjust the order -> "Complete."
