# User Management

To ensure that users of the BlueKing products are trustworthy, the PaaS platform provides a "Unified Login" module for the entire BlueKing ecosystem, which includes a basic account system. Once the BlueKing ecosystem products are set up and deployed, a URL will be provided for users to access.

The basic information such as user accounts and passwords is managed through the "User Management" SaaS. Whether a user has certain permissions within the PaaS platform or other systems is applied for and obtained through the "Permission Center" SaaS.

In summary, user management within the BlueKing ecosystem can be divided as follows:

- User Information
User information is managed through the User Management SaaS, including the division of enterprise organizational structure, user information entry, user password search and revision, etc.

- User Permissions

  - System Developers
  Can integrate their system into the Permission Center for unified management within the BlueKing ecosystem.

  - Product Users
  Can choose to obtain corresponding permissions based on their needs, either by system or user group.
