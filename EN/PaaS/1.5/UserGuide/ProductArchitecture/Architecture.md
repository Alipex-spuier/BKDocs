# Product Architecture Diagram

The PaaS platform not only provides developers with application service runtime and development environments as a service, but also offers efficient and convenient development services such as component systems, unified login, permission management, backend frameworks, MagicBox, desktop/workbench, etc.

Ordinary users enter through the "workbench" to access the product entries they need and can customize their personal "work panel" according to their habits.
