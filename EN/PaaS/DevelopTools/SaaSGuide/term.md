# Terminology

- [**BlueKing Development Framework 2.0**](./DevBasics/README.md) : A `Python framework` for quickly developing SaaS on the BlueKing PaaS platform. This development framework is based on the `Django framework` architecture and is extended on this basis to add unique features of the BlueKing system, such as: `Authentication`, `ESB call` and `Template rendering`, so that developers can focus more on the `Logical development` of SaaS.

- **BlueKing PaaS Access Address** : For example, `paas.blueking.com`, the access address of BlueKing after successfully deploying the private version of BlueKing

- **Application ID** : {APP_CODE}, the `Unique ID` generated after creating an application in the BlueKing Developer Center (found in `BlueKing PaaS Access Address`)

- **Application TOKEN** : {SECRET_KEY}, the `Secrecy Key` matching the `Application ID` generated after creating an application in the BlueKing Developer Center
