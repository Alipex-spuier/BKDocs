# Introduction to Python Development Framework

The Python development framework is a Python framework that integrates the functions of the BlueKing system, allowing developers to quickly develop SaaS on the BlueKing PaaS platform.

The development framework is based on the Django framework architecture and is extended on this basis to add the unique functions of the BlueKing system,

such as: authentication, ESB calls, and template rendering, so that developers can focus more on the logic development of SaaS.
