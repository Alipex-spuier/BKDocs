# Public script

The function of the public script is exactly the same as the script management under the business. The difference is that the public script is oriented to the platform as a whole, while the business script is oriented to a single business. The object dimensions of the two are different.

For function introduction, please refer to [Script Management](./Scripts.md)

The usage scenario provided by public scripts is to extract some common scripts for direct use by businesses within the enterprise, and to manage/review them uniformly by public script maintainers, for example:

- The system operation and maintenance group of the company/department provides some common server initialization scripts
- The DBA team of the company/department provides some processing logic scripts for common database scenarios, such as MySQL installation, tuning, etc.
- The configuration management post of the company/department provides some common scripts for common business configuration logic checking process
- and so on and so forth...
