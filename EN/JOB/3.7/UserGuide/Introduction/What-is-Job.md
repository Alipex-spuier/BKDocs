# Product Introduction

**The operation platform fully supports IPv6 features from version V3.7**

## Product description

The job platform (Job) is an atomic platform that provides basic operations based on the Agent pipeline of the BlueKing management and control platform; it has tens of thousands of concurrent processing capabilities, and supports script execution, file pull/distribution, scheduled tasks, etc. In addition to a series of basic operation and maintenance scenarios, it also supports the assembly of fragmented single tasks into an automated operation process through process scheduling capabilities; and each task can be used as an atomic node for use by upper-layer or peripheral systems/platforms to realize scheduling automation .
