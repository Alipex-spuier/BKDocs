    - purpose

      The job platform supports the management of `system account` and `database account`

    - type

      For the system account, it is divided into `Linux account` or `Windows account`

    - name

      The name is the real execution account name on the corresponding server (such as: root, Administrator, user00, etc.)

    - alias

      Because accounts with the same name on different servers may have different passwords, the alias here is to solve this problem

    - describe

      Remark description information for this account

3. **Account creation complete**
