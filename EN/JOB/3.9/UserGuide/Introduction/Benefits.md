# Product advantages

The operation platform is the most basic/solid atomic platform at the bottom of the BlueKing platform, carrying Tencent Gamesâ€™ years of experience in massive automated operation and maintenance scenarios.

"**Stable, Efficient**" is its endorsement! You can safely hand over the basic operation scenarios of operation and maintenance to it, and it will definitely give you a satisfactory answer that will live up to expectations!

## Innate cross-cloud management and control capabilities

Relying on the multi-cloud networking capabilities of the BlueKing management and control platform, the operation platform is inherently **supporting the scenario of executing scripts and distributing files across multi-cloud regions**; it solves the rigid needs of enterprise servers distributed in multiple cloud regions but requiring unified management and maintenance!

## Stable and efficient mass execution capabilities

Only one BlueKing Agent is needed to realize the concurrent execution of **million servers** operations through the operation platform;

By entrusting it with the responsibility of automating basic operation and maintenance operations, enterprises can focus on expanding business volume without any scruples, without worrying about back-end operation support issues.

## File transfer is more powerful and flexible

The operation platform is particularly handy in dealing with large-volume and large-capacity file distribution scenarios, thanks to the fact that it is based on Agent using **BT (BitTorrent) protocol**; this P2P mode has natural advantages in processing large files , you can make full use of point-to-point to share resources, so as to achieve the effect of rapid file distribution, and also support breakpoint resume.

## Safe and reliable high-risk command detection capability

As the underlying atomic operation platform for server OS, it is very important to check whether the user operation instructions are compliant and safe! The operation platform supports the setting of detection rules for high-risk command statements in various script languages through regular expressions, and provides blocked operation logs; even if the peripheral system schedules execution through the API form, it can be detected and intercepted in real time, making server operations safer !

## Complete script version management

The cloud-based script version management mode fits the concept of modern open collaboration, and collaborators can share script resources conveniently with the help of the platform;

With the version management function, you can well control the online/offline status of the version, and can quickly disable and stop loss in time when a security breach occurs!

## Job arrangement, everything is a scene

When an operation scenario requires multiple steps to be executed in series, if you manually click and execute them one by one, the efficiency is too low! Moreover, there is no way to settle down well to facilitate subsequent continuous use and maintenance.

The job management function of the job platform solves this problem very well. Users can configure the corresponding execution steps in the "job template", and then derive the corresponding "execution plan" according to the demand scenario;

In this way, the relationship between job templates and instances is clearly distinguished, strong coupling relationships are avoided, and subsequent management and maintenance of usage scenarios are facilitated.

## The original Cron timing task

Retains the native Linux Crontab timing task usage habit, so that operation and maintenance colleagues can get started more smoothly and quickly;

More intimate monitoring functions help you discover and grasp the trends and execution of scheduled tasks in a timely manner.

## API is open, "connection" helps the ecology

The operation platform has opened the API interface, which is opened in the form of atomic nodes and provided to other systems or platforms for scheduling, making **ecological** "**connection**" more vivid!
